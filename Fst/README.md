Calculating Fst Values
================
Alexandra Files

I calculated Fst values and fixed differences between each population of
*Sterrhoptilus* using this
[script](Sterrhoptilus_FstandFixedDifferencesMatrix.R). I split *S.
dennistouni* into Northern and Southern populations by denoting all
individuals from the putative hybrid zone as “Southern” and all other
birds as “Northern”.
