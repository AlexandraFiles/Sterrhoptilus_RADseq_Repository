This folder contains all files and results from running *IQTree* to make a phylogenetic tree and the unrooted phylogenetic network using *SplitsTree*.

### IQTree

The folder [IQTree](IQTree) contains the bash script for running *IQTree* and all the subsequent results. I generated [pops.phy](./IQTree/pops.phy) file for input into *IQTree* with *Stack's* population model with [whitelist.txt](./IQTree/whitelist.txt)(containing all locus names) and [iqtree.popmap.txt](./IQTree/iqtree.popmap.txt)(containing all samples) files.
I performed 1000 ultra-fast bootstrap replicates and had IQTree select the best AIC tree.

I visualized [pops.phy.treefile](IQTree/pops.phy.treefile) with *FigTree*, rooted on the outgroup *D. plateni*.

### SplitsTree

I prepared the vcf file for *SplitsTree* by editing sample names and making a pairwise divergence matrix using the script [Sterrhoptilus_PreparationforSplitsTree](Sterrhoptilus_PreparationforSplitsTree.R), generating the [input text file](splitstree.nooutgroup.txt) for visualization in *SplitsTree*.
