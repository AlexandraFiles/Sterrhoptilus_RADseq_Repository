This folder contains all files and results from running *IQTree* to make a phylogenetic tree, an unrooted phylogenetic network using *SplitsTree*, and a species tree using *SNAPP*.

### IQTree

The folder [IQTree](IQTree) contains the bash script for running *IQTree* and all the subsequent results. I generated [pops.phy](./IQTree/pops.phy) file for input into *IQTree* with *Stack's* population model with [whitelist.txt](./IQTree/whitelist.txt) (containing all locus names) and [iqtree.popmap.txt](./IQTree/iqtree.popmap.txt) (containing all samples) files. I performed 1000 ultra-fast bootstrap replicates and had IQTree select the best AIC tree.

I visualized [pops.phy.treefile](IQTree/pops.phy.treefile) with *FigTree*, rooted on the outgroup *D. plateni*.

### SplitsTree

I prepared the vcf file for *SplitsTree* by editing sample names and making a pairwise divergence matrix using the script [Sterrhoptilus_PreparationforSplitsTree](Sterrhoptilus_PreparationforSplitsTree.R), generating the [input text file](splitstree.nooutgroup.txt) for visualization in *SplitsTree*.

### SNAPP

I randomly subsampled my data to have three individuals from each species (putative hybrids were not eligible to be selected for subsampling) five separate times, using the [Preparation for Snapp script](./SNAPP/Sterrhoptilus_PreparationforSnappTree.R). This resulted in five nexus files, with random subsampling of the data that can be found in the [SNAPP folder](./SNAPP). For each nexus file, I used *BEAUti* to make .xml files for input into *BEAST*, specifying ... model specifications.  All nexus files, xml files, and output trees can be found in the [SNAPP folder](./SNAPP).

All species trees converged on the same topology, tree from [1.nex](./SNAPP/1.nex) is shown below.
